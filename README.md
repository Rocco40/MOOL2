MOO2 Launcher
=============

Is a Tk GUI for installing and running unofficial fan patch 1.50 for **Master of Orion 2**. While you can install and run the patch manually, using Launcher has some perks:

- Installator checks whether your copy of the game is recent enough.
- Installator auto-detects game path for Steam or GOG package.
- It's easy to configure DOSBox, in particular to setup network multiplayer.
- It's easy to change enabled mods, no need to edit configs.
- Quick access to build lists and scripts.
- All documentation and links available in help menu.

MOO2 Launcher is free software, see src/LAUNCHER.TXT for details.

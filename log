        x respect nested enables?
                - Goal: make <None> formally correct
                - Cosmetic enables won't work
                - Mod checksum will at least show the effect
                        - but won't make uncanny NONE go away
                - super-duper goal is to just mention correct enables in ICE and
                  they are set, not to set parameters in ICE itself. So that mods can
                  enable other mods when enabled.
                        - The problem it will only work via launcher, in manual install ice will
                          lose it's enables (actually not, if included, mods will still work)
                - possibly forbid mods known to be wrong?

    current installation selection
        list of installations (dct path -> data)
        display target properties
            current version
            x (too verbose) current path
        when installing confirm downgrade?
        cancel button should appear in installer if something is already installed
        more logical install/unistall/switch choice
            show which location (and version) is current, at least in installer
            + autoselect current destination
        nicer installation path selection
            add currently known path

    use themes
    editable basic dosbox config
        check dosbox config overrides previous correctly
            different configs
            same configs

    die if in install mode and no package
        actually live if we have switch
        not a normal situation anyway

    a way to force locale
        via env?
            msgcat::mclocale
        select language in menu

    shortcuts in menu
        -underline
        bind

    unify colors between platforms

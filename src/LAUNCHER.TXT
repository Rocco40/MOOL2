    1. Overview

Launcher is a GUI program for installing, configuring and running
unofficial fan patch 1.50 for Master of Orion 2. Since 1.50.8 the
patch supports improved mod format which allows Launcher to detect
installed mods and present available options to user. Launcher also
exposes few DOSBox options, in particular network multiplayer is now
trivial to setup. In launch window right-clicking any mod or option
brings up a window with its discription.

Launcher package normally includes the latest 1.50 patch package under
MOO2.1.50.* subdirectory, so you don't need to download it separately.

You MUST OWN a copy of Master of Orion 2, to install or run the patch.
This package does not contain original game files.


    2. System requirements

Windows XP through 10 are supported, older versions are not.

Launcher is likely to work on any recent GNU/Linux distro, at least
Ubuntu and Fedora were tested. In fact any Unix-like system with fresh
enough Tk toolkit should be capable of running Launcher.
